# NeuroVision: Neural Network Visualizer

NeuroVision is an interactive web-based visualization tool that shows you exactly how a neural network learns, step by step. It is designed to help students, educators, and enthusiasts understand the inner workings of neural networks in an intuitive and engaging way.

## Features

- Visualize neurons, layers, and connections in a clean and simple interface
- Step-by-step training process with real-time updates
- Explanation panel that describes each phase of the learning process
- Practical examples demonstrating neural network behavior
- Responsive design optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
